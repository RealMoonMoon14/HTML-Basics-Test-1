<ul>
  <li>Get Into My Top Pick University (California Polytechnic)</li>
  <li>Get a Good Job After University</li>
  <li>Become a Software Engineer</li>
</ul>

</b>

<p> <i> I want to get into my top pick university of California Polytechnic due to their great, ABET certified Software Engineering program. Along with being in California, which lets me still have a semi-urban lifestyle that I prefer. I want to get a good job that pays well after university so I can make enough money to support my life. I want to become a software engineer because I find software, programs and computers in general very interesting and would be happy to make a career out of it. </i> </p>

<ul>
  <li>Get Better At Coding + Web Design</li>
  <li>Improve in Fighting Games</li>
  <li>Have Enough Time to Enjoy Life</li>
</ul>

</b>

<p> <i> I would like to get better at coding and web design in general because personally I find it very enjoyable, and learning more would further that passion and skill. I would like to improve in Fighting Games because they are my favorite genre of video games, along with the one I play the most. I play them competitively, so improving and getting better is all part of the enjoyment for me. I would like to make enough time to enjoy life because often I feel stuffed with too much work and that I can't really do much else. Having a break from that every once in a while is nice. </i> </p>

<h1> ‡µ† Inspiring Division ‡µ† </h1>

<b>

<ul>
  <li>"Pick a top-tier" - Sanford Kelly</li>
  <li>"Even if my actions turn out to be a mistake. If my heart was in the right place, that's all that matters to me!" - Yuuko</li>
  <li>"Everybody has things they aren‚Äôt good at or can‚Äôt do. We cover each other‚Äôs weakness. That‚Äôs what a party‚Äôs for.‚Äù - Manato</li>
</ul>

</b>

<p> <i> The inspiration from "Pick a top-tier" to me comes within the idea that if I want to become better at something. I need to work on myself. Be a better person. Train and learn towards what I want to become. "Even if my actions turn out to be a mistake. If my heart was in the right place, that's all that matters to me!" sings to me in the idea that I follow the same ideals. If I mess up, if I crash and fall down. If I trip and trip. No matter what, I will get back up again. Even if I gets worse, I will be true to myself and know that I did what I believed was right. "Everybody has things they aren't good at or can't do. We cover each other's weakness. That's what a party's for." helps remind me of friends and family. My support group, because no man is an island. We all need help, we all fall down. And sometimes it's hard to get up. We can't do everything, but if someone is there to give us a helping hand. You can make it through. </i> </p>

<h1> ‚ÅÇ Special Meaning Division ‚ÅÇ </h1>

<b>

<ul>
  <li>"wifi is ok if you're close to the router" - Nanaya Shiki</li>
  <li>"It is important to know why you are throwing them (fireballs) in the first place. Obviously they cause damage. But more importantly, they cause your opponent to dance." - Gerald Lee</li>
  <li>"Isn't that just normal though?" - Kobeni Higashiyama</li>
</ul>

</b>

<p> <i> Starting with "wifi is ok if you're close to the router", this just holds a special meaning to me because it is a long running joke in the community I play with. In fighting games, a wired, stable connection is a neccessity. So "wifi is okay" is funny because wifi tends to be the most unstable, unviable connection type for what I play. "It is important to know why you are throwing them (fireballs) in the first place. Obviously they cause damage. But more importantly, they cause your opponent to dance." is something that also relates to fighting games, (can you tell that they are a big part of my life?). It embodies my playstyle and idea of leadership in life. I would rather be in the driver's seat, making the decisions and leading the way. Not being in control worries me a lot, so making my "opponent" or whoever I'm with dance to my beat is important. Lastly, "Isn't that just normal though?" links with the fact that I really struggle making connections. Fact of the matter is that I don't have many friends, and I struggle talking to people. I'm out of touch with most social norms. I don't use social media like Snapchat or Instagram. I feel empty whenever I walk by people in the halls. Talking to their friends, chatting it up. As I said before, being out of touch with what's going on today is a real kicker. I don't get most social cues, nor do I understand a lot of people's feelings or motivations if they do speak to me. But in the end, I am who I am. And that's my own normal. </i> </p>

<p> <i> The first image shows how I am tired. I tend not to get much rest and it makes me sleepy. The second image is me losing my sensibility and idea to reason. I do not think an awful lot in this state and I am glad for it. The final image is me coping with the fact that I often have to do work up until very late and that I will always have to go "It is what it is". </p> </i>
